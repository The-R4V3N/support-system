- User Registration: Users can create an account.

- Registred user can view tickets and open new once. They can also  delete tickets or make notes to there ticketss.

- Mobile and Desktop Compatibility: The support system is fully responsive.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Set up your development environment and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
- Install Node.js from the [official Website](https://nodejs.org) if you dont have it already
- You will need a geocoding api key for this to work which you can obtain from google cloud
  
### In the project  directory run

 `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies

will be update once the project is done

  Now you are ready to use it
  
## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run start` to start the backend server.

`npm run server` to start the nodemon backend server.

`npm run client` to start the frontend.

Or you can run `npm run dev` to start everything up at the same time.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The server runs on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
